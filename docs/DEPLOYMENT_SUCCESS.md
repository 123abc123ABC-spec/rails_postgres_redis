# 🎉 Deployment Success!

## What Happened

Your GitHub Actions workflows are now fully automated and working!

### Build Workflow (build.yml)
- ✅ Triggers on: Push to `main` branch
- ✅ Builds Docker image
- ✅ Pushes to AWS ECR
- ✅ Automatically triggers deploy workflow

### Deploy Workflow (deploy.yml)
- ✅ Triggers on: Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
- ✅ Pulls latest image from ECR
- ✅ Deploys to EC2 using Kamal
- ✅ Verifies health endpoint

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Push code to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# This automatically:
# 1. Builds Docker image
# 2. Pushes to ECR
# 3. Deploys to EC2
# 4. Verifies health check
```

### Manual Deployment (If Build Fails)
1. Go to GitHub → Actions
2. Click "Deploy to Production" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Deploys latest image from ECR without rebuilding

## 🔄 Concurrency Settings

Both workflows have concurrency enabled:
- **group**: Identifies which workflows can't run simultaneously
- **cancel-in-progress**: Cancels previous runs if new one starts

This means:
- Only one build runs at a time
- Only one deployment runs at a time
- If you push while build is running, old build is cancelled
- If you manually trigger deploy while one is running, old deploy is cancelled

## ✅ Verification

### Check Build Status
1. Go to GitHub → Actions
2. Click "Build and Push to ECR"
3. View logs

### Check Deploy Status
1. Go to GitHub → Actions
2. Click "Deploy to Production"
3. View logs

### Check Application
```bash
# SSH to EC2
ssh -i ~/.ssh/rails-demo.pem ubuntu@13.60.250.114

# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost/health

# View Kamal status
kamal status
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify Dockerfile is correct
- Check AWS credentials

### Deploy Failed
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify SSH key is correct
- Check EC2 security groups
- Verify Kamal config

### Health Check Failed
- SSH to EC2
- Check if container is running: `docker ps`
- Check logs: `docker logs rails-app-latest`
- Verify database connection

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Monitor the deployment in GitHub Actions
2. Verify the application is running on EC2
3. Test the health endpoint
4. Make code changes and push to trigger automatic deployment
